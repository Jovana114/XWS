This project is a full-stack application built with Java Spring, React, and Maven, utilizing a microservices architecture with communication facilitated through gRPC. The application, inspired by Airbnb, provides a user-friendly platform.

Java Spring: The backend of the application is developed using the Java Spring framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for building enterprise-level applications.

React: The frontend is built using React, a popular TypeScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive UI components.

Maven: Maven serves as the build tool for the project, simplifying the build process and managing project dependencies.

gRPC: Microservices communicate seamlessly using gRPC, a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework, ensuring efficient and low-latency data exchange between different components.

MongoDB: The project utilizes MongoDB as the database system, offering a flexible and scalable NoSQL solution for storing and retrieving data.

Docker: The application is containerized using Docker, allowing seamless packaging and deployment across diverse environments.

Microservices Architecture: The project follows a microservices architecture, promoting scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation by organizing functionalities into independent microservices.

gRPC Communication: Microservices communicate efficiently using gRPC, ensuring seamless data exchange between different components of the system.

Airbnb-Inspired Design: The user interface and overall design draw inspiration from Airbnb, providing users with a familiar and intuitive experience.
